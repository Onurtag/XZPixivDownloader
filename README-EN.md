# Introduction:

This is a Pixiv image downloader written in JavaScript that supports many page types and filters.

Some additional features have been added, such as removing ads, quick collections, Add tag to unclassified work, and viewing pictures.

It is essentially a user script (UserScript) that must be installed using the User Script Manager.

**note:**

This tool has a Chrome extension and can be installed in the [Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hfgoikdmppghehigkckknikdgdcjbfpl).

# Tips:

- Browser's resource limits

When you download picture, this page uses more memory and cpu resources. If you switch to another page and the download page is not activated, Browser will limit the resource usage of the download page, resulting in slow download.

How to solve: Pull out the downloaded tabs individually and become a separate window. This page is the only one in the new window and it is always active. Downloads are not affected, we can use other pages too.

- How to view the animation ( ugoira image ):

The animated picture is suffixed with ugoira. Please install HoneyView software. Open the ugoira file with HoneyView to see the animation effect.

Now you can download the gif image directly for a single animation.
